In probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), model parameters are repeatedly sampled from the joint parameter space to generate a set of model runs, also known as PSA iterations.

The choice of probability distribution for a given parameter depends on the parameter's range. If the parameter is constrained between 0 and 1, the beta distribution is commonly used. If only non-negativity is desired, the gamma distribution is a good choice. If there are no constraints on the parameter's range and probability density is symmetric about the mean, the normal distribution is sufficient.

Typically, for each parameter, we will have a base case value ($$B$$), a lower value ($$L$$), and an upper value ($$U$$). One common approach to designing a probability distribution is to assume $$B$$ is the median, and $$L$$ and $$U$$ are the 2.5<sup>th</sup> and 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentiles, i.e., the bounds of the 95% confidence interval.

This tutorial will explain how to parameterize the normal, beta, and gamma distributions under the above assumption.

##### **Normal distribution**

If $$L$$ and $$U$$ are equidistant from $$B$$ *and* a symmetrical distribution is desired, then the normal distribution is ideal. Recall from high school statistics, that (1) the mean of the normal distribution is equal to its median; and (2) 1.96 standard deviations above and below the mean delineate the 95% confidence interval. Therefore, the distribution we need is:

$${\rm Normal}\bigg(B,\ \frac{B-L}{1.96}\bigg).$$

##### **Beta distribution**

There is no analytical way to do this so we have to resort to some kind of calibration approach. Here is an example using simulated annealing in R:

{% highlight R %}
library(GenSA)

# Quantile targets
target <- c(L, B, U)

# MSE between estimated quantiles and target quantiles
score <- function(params) {
  est <- qbeta(c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975), shape1 = params[1], shape2 = params[2])
  return(sum((est - target)^2))
}

# Upper and lower bounds for shape1 and shape2
lower <- c(1, 1)
upper <- c(200, 200)

# Setting the random seed is good practice
set.seed(1)

# Run calibration
opt <- GenSA(par = mapply(runif, 1, lower, upper),
            fn = score,
            lower = lower,
            upper = upper)
{% endhighlight %}

<p style="margin-top: 25px"></p>

##### **Gamma distribution**

Same as the beta distribution, we have to use calibration. Simply replace the previous score function with:

{% highlight R %}
score <- function(params) {
  est <- qgamma(c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975), shape = params[1], scale = params[2])
  return(sum((est - target)^2))
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p style="margin-top: 25px"></p>

##### **Validation**

The final step is to check that the fitted distribution looks reasonable (make a plot!) and its quantiles do indeed match up with $$B$$, $$L$$, and $$U$$.
