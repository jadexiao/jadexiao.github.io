I am a Data Scientist at [Value Analytics Labs](https://www.valueanalyticslabs.com), where I specialize in health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) with technical expertise in simulation modeling and cost-effectiveness analysis.

I graduated from Georgia Tech with a PhD in Operations Research, advised by Professors Turgay Ayer and Jagpreet Chhatwal.

My doctoral thesis comprised work on three current pandemics: COVID-19, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and opioid addiction. See [`/publications`](/publications) for details!
